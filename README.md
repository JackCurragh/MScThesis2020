# MScThesis2020
 Towards the Development of Accurate Representations of Protein Coding Loci
 
By Jack Tierney for the degree of Masters in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
Under the supervision of Prof. Pasha Baranov

School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork

The python scripts relating to the three main branches of this project are available here.

# Repository Structure

TripsSplice directory relates to the implementation of splice graphs and super transcripts using python 3

TripsCountPy2 contains the scripts used to quantify the reads across the locus using both approaches described in the thesis.

TripsViz is a clone of the official github.com/skiniry/Trips-Viz in which I have implemented the transcript quantification.


# Note

Each directory has their own README.md files with specifics on those scripts.

Please find a copy of the thesis in thesis.pdf.
